Absolute_Checkoutpromocodes
===============================

Magento module to allow customers to apply a promo code directly in the checkout

Overview
-----------
Out of the box, Magento doesn't allow for applying a promo code as part of the checkout. This plugin fixes that!

Install
--------
Download the current zip from https://github.com/absolutedesignltd/Absolute_Checkoutpromocodes/archive/master.zip

Simply extract the directories (there are two directories app/ and js/) and copy them into the root of your Magento install (you will probably be asked to 'merge' them).

Clear your cache and disable your code compliation if enabled, and all the blocks and js are inserted automatically.

Contributions
